Sinc
my
first
visit
to
Israel
35
year
ago
I
have
return
mani
time
and
made
mani
friend
I
have
work
with
and
learn
from
some
of
Israel
s
great
leader
although
I
don
t
think
Yitzhak

ever
forgav
me
for
banish
him
to

White

Now
I
am
here
as
a

I
know
that
all
of
you
understand
what
s
at
stake
in

Our
next

walk
into
the
Oval

next
Januari
and
immedi
face
a
world
of
both
peril
we
must
meet
with
strength

skill
and
opportun
we
must
seiz

The
next

will
sit
down
at

start
make
decis
that
will
affect
both
the
live
and
livelihood
of
everi
American
and
the

So
we
have
to
get
thi
right
As

you
understand
that
while
the
turmoil
of
the
Middl

present
enorm
challeng

complex
walk

Candid
for

who
think
the

can
outsourc

It
would
be
a

We

Becaus
we

Israel

we

we

never

the

of

or
the

of

Todai
American
and
Israeli
face
moment
choic
that
will
shape
the
futur
of
our

and
of
both
our
nation
The
first
choic
is
thi
ar
we
prepar
to
take
the
U
S
Israel
allianc
to
the
next
level
Thi
relationship
ha
alwai
been
stronger
and
deeper
than
the
headlin
might
lead
you
to
believ
Our
work
togeth
to
develop
the
Iron
Dome
save
mani
Israeli
live
when
Hama
rocket
began
to
fly
I
saw
it
effect
firsthand
in
2012
when
I
work
with
Prime
Minist
Netanyahu
to
negoti
a
ceas
fire
in
Gaza
And
if
I
m
fortun
enough
to
be
elect
presid
the
Unite
State
will
reaffirm
we
have
a
strong
and
endur
nation
interest
in
Israel
s
secur
And
we
will
never
allow
Israel
s
adversari
to
think
a
wedg
can
be
driven
between
us
As
we
have
differ
as
ani
friend
do
we
will
work
to
resolv
them
quickli
and
respectfulli
We
will
also
be
clear
that
the
Unite
State
ha
an
endur
interest
in
and
commit
to
a
more
peac
more
stabl
more
secur
Middl
East
And
we
will
step
up
our
effort
to
achiev
that
outcom
Indeed
at
a
time
of
unpreced
chao
and
conflict
in
the
region
America
need
an
Israel
strong
enough
to
deter
and
defend
against
it
enemi
strong
enough
to
work
with
us
to
tackl
share
challeng
and
strong
enough
to
take
bold
step
in
the
pursuit
of
peac
That
s
why
I
believ
we
must
take
our
allianc
to
the
next
level
I
hope
a
new
10
year
defens
memorandum
of
understand
is
conclud
as
soon
as
possibl
to
meet
Israel
s
secur
need
far
into
the
futur
That
will
also
send
a
clear
messag
to
Israel
s
enemi
that
the
Unite
State
and
Israel
stand
togeth
unit
It
s
also
why
as
presid
I
will
make
a
firm
commit
to
ensur
Israel
maintain
it
qualit
militari
edg
The
Unite
State
should
provid
Israel
with
the
most
sophist
defens
technolog
so
it
can
deter
and
stop
ani
threat
That
includ
bolster
Israeli
missil
defens
with
new
system
like
the
Arrow
Three
and
David
s
Sling
And
we
should
work
togeth
to
develop
better
tunnel
detect
technolog
to
prevent
arm
smuggl
kidnap
and
terrorist
attack
One
of
the
first
thing
I
ll
do
in
offic
is
invit
the
Israeli
prime
minist
to
visit
the
White
Hous
And
I
will
send
a
deleg
from
the
Pentagon
and
the
joint
chief
to
Israel
for
earli
consult
Let
s
also
expand
our
collabor
beyond
secur
Togeth
we
can
build
an
even
more
vibrant
cultur
of
innov
that
tighten
the
link
between
Silicon
Vallei
and
Israeli

compani
and

There
is
much
American

from

to

just
on

For

The
second
choic
we
face
is
whether
we
will
have
the
strength
and
commit
to
confront
the
adversari
that
threaten
us
especi
Iran
For
mani
year
we
ve
all
been
rightli
focus
on
the
existenti
danger
of
Iran
acquir
a
nuclear
weapon
After
all
thi
remain
an
extremist
regim
that
threaten
to
annihil
Israel
That
s
why
I
led
the
diplomaci
to
impos
crippl
sanction
and
forc
Iran
to
the
negoti
tabl
and
why
I
ultim
support
the

that

Todai
Iran

I
realli
believ
the
Unite

Israel
and
the
world
ar
safer
as
a
result
But
still
as
I
laid
out
at
a
speech
at
the
Brook
Institut
last
year
it
s
not
good
enough
to
trust
and
verifi
Our
approach
must
be
distrust
and
verifi
Thi
deal
must
come
with
vigor
enforc
strong
monitor
clear
consequ
for
ani
violat
and
a
broader
strategi
to
confront
Iran
s
aggress
across
the
region
We
cannot
forget
that
Tehran
s
fingerprint
ar
on
nearli
everi
conflict
across
the
Middl
East
from
Syria
to
Lebanon
to
Yemen
The
Iranian
Revolutionari
Guard
Corp
and
it
proxi
ar
attempt
to
establish
a
posit
on
the
Golan
from
which
to
threaten
Israel
and
thei
continu

In

an

that

in

Tonight
you
will
hear
a
lot
of
rhetor
from
the
other
candid
about
Iran
but
there
s
a
big
differ
between
talk
about
hold
Tehran
account
and
actual
do
it
Our
next
presid
ha
to
be
abl
to
hold
togeth
our
global
coalit
and
impos
real
consequ
for
even
the
smallest
violat
of
thi
agreement
We
must
maintain
the
legal
and
diplomat
architectur
to
turn
all
the
sanction
back
on
if
need
If
I
m
elect
the
leader
of
Iran
will
have
no
doubt
that
if
we
see
ani
indic
that
thei
ar
violat
their
commit
not
to
seek
develop
or
acquir
nuclear
weapon
the
Unite
State
will
act
to
stop
it
and
that
we
will
do
so
with
forc
if
necessari
Iranian
provoc
like
the
recent
ballist
missil
test
ar
also
unaccept
and
should
be
answer
firmli
and
quickli
includ
with
more
sanction
Those
missil
were
stamp
with
word
declar
and
I
quot
Israel
should
be
wipe
from
the
page
of
histori
We
know
thei
could
reach
Israel
or
hit
the
ten
of
thousand
of
American
troop
station
in
the
Middl
East
Thi
is
a
seriou
danger
and
it
demand
a
seriou
respons
The
Unite
State
must
also
continu
to
enforc
exist
sanction
and
impos
addit
sanction
as
need
on
Iran
and
the
Revolutionari
Guard
for
their
sponsorship
of
terror
illeg
arm
transfer
human
right
violat
and
other
illicit
behavior
like
cyber

We
should
continu
to
demand
the
safe
return
of
Robert
Levinson
and
all
American
citizen
unjustli
held
in
Iranian
prison
And
we
must
work
close
with
Israel
and
other
partner
to
cut
off
the
flow
of
monei
and
arm
from
Iran
to
Hezbollah
If
the
Arab
Leagu
can
design
all
of
Hezbollah
as
a
terrorist
organ
sure
it
is
time
for
our
friend
in
Europ
and
the
rest
of
the
intern
commun
to
do
so
as
well
and
to
do
that
now
At
the
same
time
America
should
alwai
stand
with
those
voic
insid
Iran
call
for
more
open
Now
look
we
know
the
suprem
leader
still
call
the
shot
and
that
the
hard
liner
ar
intent
on
keep
their
grip
on
power
But
the
Iranian
peopl
themselv
deserv
a
better
futur
and
thei
ar
try
to
make
their
voic
heard
Thei
should
know
that
America
is
not
their
enemi
thei
should
know
we
will
support
their
effort
to
bring
posit
chang
to
Iran
Now
of
cours
Iran
is
not
the
onli
threat
we
and
Israel
face
The
Unite
State
and
Israel
also
have
to
stand
togeth
against
the
threat
from
ISIS
and
other
radic
jihadist
An
ISIS
affili
in
the
Sinai
is
reportedli
step
up
attempt
to
make

in

and

On

a

Two
of
the

ar
U
S
Israeli
dual

Thi
is
a
threat
that
know
no

That
s
why
I
ve
laid
out
a
plan
to
take
the
fight
to
ISIS
from
the

on
the
ground
with
local
forc
and
onlin
where
thei

Our
goal
cannot
be
to

we
must
defeat

And
here
is
a
third

Will
we
keep

lose

Despit

remain

and
that
it
is
the
onli
wai
to

Israel

long

It
mai
be
difficult
to
imagin
progress
in
thi
current

when
mani
Israeli
doubt
that
a

and
capabl
partner
for

even
exist
But
inact
cannot
be
an
option
Israeli
deserv
a

for
the
Jewish

Palestinian
should
be
abl
to
govern

in
their

in

And
onli
a

can

those
outcom
If
we
look
at
the
broader

context
converg

could
make

Israeli

could
contribut
toward
greater
cooper
between
Israel

I
know
how
hard
all
of
thi
is
I
rememb
what
it
took
just
to

Prime

Netanyahu
and
Presid
Abba
for
the
three

of
direct

But
Israeli

Palestinian
cannot
give
up
on
the
hope
of

That
will
onli

later
All

need
to

At

Thi

And

we

We

And

some

Golda

Israel

and
wonder
what

But
we

Todai
American

Now
in

Now
we

We

1

Jew
aboard
the
St
Loui
who
were
refus
entri
in
1939
and
sent
back
to
Europ
But
America
should
be
better
than
thi
And
I
believ
it
s
our
respons
as
citizen
to
sai
so
If
you
see
bigotri
oppos
it
If
you
see
violenc
condemn
it
If
you
see
a

stand
up
to

On
Wednesdai
even
Jew
around
the
world
will
celebr
the
Festiv
of
Purim
and
children
will
learn
the
stori
of
Esther
who
refus
to
stai
silent
in
the
face
of
evil
It
wasn
t
easi
She
had
a
good
life
And
by
speak
out
she
risk
everyth
But
as
Mordecai
remind
her
we
all
have
an
oblig
to
do
our
part
when
danger
gather
And
those
of
us
with
power
or
influenc
have
a
special
respons
to
do
what
s
right
As
Elie
Wiesel
said
when
accept
the
Nobel
Peac
Prize
Neutral
help
the
oppressor
never
the
victim
Silenc
encourag
the
tormentor
never
the
torment
So
my
friend
let
us
never
be
neutral
or
silent
in
the
face
of
bigotri
Togeth
let
s
defend
the
share
valu
that
alreadi
make
America
and
Israel
great
Let
us
do
the
hard
work
necessari
to
keep
build
our
friendship
and
reach
out
to
the
next
gener
of
American
and
Israeli
so
the
bond
between
our
nation
grow
even
deeper
and
stronger
We
ar
stronger
togeth
and
if
we
face
the
futur
side
by
side
I
know
for
both
Israel
and
America
our
best
dai
ar
still
ahead
Thank
you
so
much
