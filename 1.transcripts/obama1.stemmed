Four
year
ago
I
stood
befor
you
and
told
you
my
stori
of
the
brief
union
between
a
young
man
from
Kenya
and
a
young
woman
from
Kansa
who
weren
t
well
off
or
well
known
but
share
a
belief
that
in
America
their
son
could
achiev
whatev
he
put
hi
mind
to
It
is
that
promis
that
ha
alwai
set
thi
countri
apart
that
through
hard
work
and
sacrific
each
of
us
can
pursu
our
individu
dream
but
still
come
togeth
as
on
American
famili
to
ensur
that
the
next
gener
can
pursu
their
dream
as
well
That
s
why
I
stand
here
tonight
Becaus
for
two
hundr
and
thirti
two
year
at
each
moment
when
that
promis
wa
in
jeopardi
ordinari
men
and
women
student
and
soldier
farmer
and
teacher
nurs
and
janitor
found
the
courag
to
keep
it
aliv
We
meet
at
on
of
those
defin
moment
a
moment
when
our
nation
is
at
war
our
economi
is
in
turmoil
and
the
American
promis
ha
been
threaten
onc
more
Tonight
more
American
ar
out
of
work
and
more
ar
work
harder
for
less
More
of
you
have
lost
your
home
and
even
more
ar
watch
your
home
valu
plummet
More
of
you
have
car
you
can
t
afford
to
drive
credit
card
bill
you
can
t
afford
to
pai
and
tuition
that
s
beyond
your
reach
These
challeng
ar
not
all
of
govern
s
make
But
the
failur
to
respond
is
a
direct
result
of
a
broken
polit
in
Washington
and
the
fail
polici
of
Georg
W
Bush
America
we
ar
better
than
these
last
eight
year
We
ar
a
better
countri
than
thi
Thi
countri
is
more
decent
than
on
where
a
woman
in
Ohio
on
the
brink
of
retir
find
herself
on
ill
awai
from
disast
after
a
lifetim
of
hard
work
Thi
countri
is
more
gener
than
on
where
a
man
in
Indiana
ha
to
pack
up
the
equip
he
s
work
on
for
twenti
year
and
watch
it
ship
off
to
China
and
then
choke
up
as
he
explain
how
he
felt
like
a
failur
when
he
went
home
to
tell
hi
famili
the

We
ar
more
compassion
than
a
govern
that
let
veteran
sleep
on
our
street
and
famili
slide

that

on

while
a

Tonight
I
sai
to
the
American
peopl
to
Democrat
and
Republican
and
Independ
across
thi
great
land
enough
Thi
moment
thi
elect
is
our
chanc
to
keep
in
the
21st
centuri
the
American
promis
aliv
Becaus
next
week
in
Minnesota
the
same
parti
that
brought
you
two
term
of
Georg
Bush
and
Dick
Chenei
will
ask
thi
countri
for
a
third
And
we
ar
here
becaus
we
love
thi
countri
too
much
to
let
the
next
four
year
look
like
the
last
eight
On
Novemb
4th
we
must
stand
up
and
sai
Eight
is
enough
Now
let
there
be
no
doubt
The
Republican
nomine
John
McCain
ha
worn
the
uniform
of
our
countri
with
braveri
and
distinct
and
for
that
we
ow
him
our
gratitud
and
respect
And
next
week
we
ll
also
hear
about
those
occas
when
he
s
broken
with
hi
parti
as
evid
that
he
can
deliv
the
chang
that
we
need
But
the
record
s
clear
John
McCain
ha
vote
with
Georg
Bush
nineti
percent
of
the
time
Senat
McCain
like
to
talk
about
judgment
but
realli
what
doe
it
sai
about
your
judgment
when
you
think
Georg
Bush
ha
been
right
more
than
nineti
percent
of
the
time
I
don
t
know
about
you
but
I
m
not
readi
to
take
a
ten
percent
chanc
on
chang
The
truth
is
on
issu
after
issu
that
would
make
a
differ
in
your
live
on
health
care
and
educ
and
the
economi
Senat
McCain
ha
been
anyth
but
independ
He
said
that
our
economi
ha
made
great
progress
under
thi
Presid
He
said
that
the
fundament
of
the
economi
ar
strong
And
when
on
of
hi
chief
advisor
the
man
who
wrote
hi
econom
plan
wa
talk
about
the
anxieti
American
ar
feel
he
said
that
we
were
just
suffer
from
a
mental
recess
and
that
we
ve
becom
and
I
quot
a
nation
of
whiner
A
nation
of
whiner
Tell
that
to
the
proud
auto
worker
at
a
Michigan
plant
who
after
thei
found
out
it
wa
close
kept
show
up
everi
dai
and
work
as
hard
as
ever
becaus
thei
knew
there
were
peopl
who
count
on
the
brake
that
thei
made
Tell
that
to
the
militari
famili
who
shoulder
their
burden
silent
as
thei
watch
their
love
on
leav
for
their
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
tour
of
duti
These
ar
not
whiner
Thei
work
hard
and
give
back
and
keep
go
without
complaint
These
ar
the
American
that
I
know
Now
I
don
t
believ
that
Senat
McCain
doesn
t
care
what
s
go
on
in
the
live
of
American
I
just
think
he
doesn
t
know
Why
els
would
he
defin
middl
class
as
someon
make
under
five
million
dollar
a
year
How
els
could
he
propos
hundr
of
billion
in
tax
break
for
big
corpor
and
oil
compani
but
not
on
penni
of
tax
relief
to
more
than
on
hundr
million
American
How
els
could
he
offer
a
health
care
plan
that
would
actual
tax
peopl
s
benefit
or
an
educ
plan
that
would
do
noth
to
help
famili
pai
for
colleg
or
a
plan
that
would
privat
Social
Secur
and
gambl
your
retir
It
s
not
becaus
John
McCain
doesn
t
care
It
s
becaus
John
McCain
doesn
t
get
it
For
over
two
decad
he
s
subscrib
to
that
old
discredit
Republican
philosophi
give
more
and
more
to
those
with
the
most
and
hope
that
prosper
trickl
down
to
everyon
els
In
Washington
thei
call
thi
the
Ownership
Societi
but
what
it
realli
mean
is
you
re
on
your
own
Out
of
work
Tough
luck
No
health
care
The
market
will
fix
it
Born
into

Pull
yourself
up
by
your

bootstrap
even
if
you
don
t
have

You
re

Well
it
s
time
for
them
to
own
their
failur
It
s
time
for
us
to
chang
America
You
see
we
Democrat
have
a
veri
differ
measur
of
what
constitut
progress
in
thi
countri
We
measur
progress
by
how
mani
peopl
can
find
a
job
that
pai
the
mortgag
whether
you
can
put
a
littl
extra
monei
awai
at
the
end
of
each
month
so
you
can
somedai
watch
your
child
receiv
her
colleg
diploma
We
measur
progress
in
the
23
million
new
job
that
were
creat
when
Bill
Clinton
wa
Presid
when
the
averag
American
famili
saw
it
incom
go
up
7
500
instead
of
down
2
000
like
it
ha
under
Georg
Bush
We
measur
the
strength
of
our
economi
not
by
the
number
of
billionair
we
have
or
the
profit
of
the
Fortun
500
but
by
whether
someon
with
a
good
idea
can
take
a
risk
and
start
a
new
busi
or
whether
the
waitress
who
live
on
tip
can
take
a
dai
off
to
look
after
a
sick
kid
without
lose
her
job
an
economi
that
honor
the
digniti
of
work
The
fundament
we
us
to
measur
econom
strength
ar
whether
we
ar
live
up
to
that
fundament
promis
that
ha
made
thi
countri
great
a
promis
that
is
the
onli
reason
I
am
stand
here
tonight
Becaus
in
the
face
of
those
young
veteran
who
come
back
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
I
see
my
grandfath
who
sign
up
after
Pearl
Harbor
march
in
Patton
s
Army
and
wa
reward
by
a
grate
nation
with
the
chanc
to
go
to
colleg
on
the
GI
Bill
In
the
face
of
that
young
student
who
sleep
just
three
hour
befor
work
the
night
shift
I
think
about
my
mom
who
rais
my
sister
and
me
on
her
own
while
she
work
and
earn
her
degre
who
onc
turn
to
food
stamp
but
wa
still
abl
to
send
us
to
the
best
school
in
the
countri
with
the
help
of
student
loan
and
scholarship
When
I
listen
to
anoth
worker
tell
me
that
hi
factori
ha
shut
down
I
rememb
all
those
men
and
women
on
the
South
Side
of
Chicago
who
I
stood
by
and
fought
for
two
decad
ago
after
the
local
steel
plant
close
And
when
I
hear
a
woman
talk
about
the
difficulti
of
start
her
own
busi
I
think
about
my
grandmoth
who
work
her
wai
up
from
the
secretari
pool
to
middl
manag
despit
year
of
be
pass
over
for
promot
becaus
she
wa
a
woman
She
s
the
on
who
taught
me
about
hard
work
She
s
the
on
who
put
off
bui
a
new
car
or
a
new
dress
for
herself
so
that
I
could
have
a
better
life
She
pour
everyth
she
had
into
me
And
although
she
can
no
longer
travel
I
know
that
she
s
watch
tonight
and
that
tonight
is
her
night
as
well
I
don
t
know
what
kind
of
live
John
McCain
think
that
celebr
lead
but
thi
ha
been
mine
These
ar
my
hero
Their
ar
the
stori
that
shape
me
And
it
is
on
their
behalf
that
I
intend
to
win
thi
elect
and
keep
our
promis
aliv
as
Presid
of
the
Unite
State
What
is
that
promis
It
s
a
promis
that
sai
each
of
us
ha
the
freedom
to
make
of
our
own
live
what
we
will
but
that
we
also
have
the
oblig
to
treat
each
other
with
digniti
and
respect
It
s
a
promis
that
sai
the
market
should
reward
drive
and
innov
and
gener
growth
but
that
busi
should
live
up
to
their
respons
to
creat
American
job
look
out
for
American
worker
and
plai
by
the
rule
of
the
road
Our
is
a
promis
that
sai
govern
cannot
solv
all
our
problem
but
what
it
should
do
is
that
which
we
cannot
do
for
ourselv
protect
us
from
harm
and
provid
everi
child
a
decent
educ
keep
our
water
clean
and
our
toi
safe
invest
in
new
school
and
new
road
and
new
scienc
and
technolog
Our
govern
should
work
for
us
not
against
us
It
should
help
us
not
hurt
us
It
should
ensur
opportun
not
just
for
those
with
the
most
monei
and
influenc
but
for
everi
American
who
s
will
to
work
That
s
the
promis
of
America
the
idea
that
we
ar
respons
for
ourselv
but
that
we
also
rise
or
fall
as
on
nation
the
fundament
belief
that
I
am
my
brother
s
keeper
I
am
my
sister
s
keeper
That
s
the
promis
we
need
to
keep
That
s
the
chang
we
need
right
now
So
let
me
spell
out
exactli
what
that
chang
would
mean
if
I
am
Presid
Chang
mean
a
tax
code
that
doesn
t
reward
the
lobbyist
who
wrote
it
but
the
American
worker
and
small
busi
who
deserv
it
Unlike
John
McCain
I
will
stop
give
tax
break
to
corpor
that
ship
job
oversea
and
I
will
start
give
them
to
compani
that
creat
good
job
right
here
in
America
I
will
elimin
capit
gain
tax
for
the
small
busi
and
the
start
up
that
will
creat
the
high
wage
high
tech
job
of
tomorrow
I
will
cut
tax
cut
tax
for
95
of
all
work
famili
Becaus
in
an
economi
like
thi
the
last
thing
we
should
do
is
rais
tax
on
the
middl
class
And
for
the
sake
of
our
economi
our
secur
and
the
futur
of
our
planet
I
will
set
a
clear
goal
as
Presid
in
ten
year
we
will
final
end
our
depend
on
oil
from
the
Middl
East
Washington
s
been
talk
about
our
oil
addict
for
the
last
thirti
year
and
John
McCain
ha
been
there
for
twenti
six
of
them
In
that
time
he
s
said
no
to
higher
fuel
effici
standard
for
car
no
to
invest
in
renew
energi
no
to
renew
fuel
And
todai
we
import
tripl
the
amount
of
oil
as
the
dai
that
Senat
McCain
took
offic
Now
is
the
time
to
end
thi
addict
and
to
understand
that
drill
is
a
stop
gap
measur
not
a
long
term
solut
Not
even

As
Presid
I
will
tap
our
natur
ga
reserv
invest
in
clean

find

I

help
our
auto
compani
re

so
that
the
fuel
effici
car
of
the
futur

built
right
here
in
America
I
ll
make
it
easier
for
the
American
peopl
to
afford
these
new

And
I
ll
invest
150
billion
dollar
over
the
next
decad
in

America
now

Now
is
the
time
to
final
meet
our
moral
oblig
to
provid
everi

class
educ
becaus
it
will

noth
less
to

Michel
and
I
ar
onli
here
tonight
becaus
we
were
given
a
chanc
at
an
educ
And
I
will
not
settl
for
an
America
where
some
kid
don

have
that
chanc
I

invest
in
earli

And
in

I

And

Now
is
the
time

And
now
is
the
time
to
keep
the
promis
of
equal
pai
for
an
equal
dai
s
work
becaus
I
want
my
daughter
to
have
exactli
the
same
opportun
as
your
son
Now
mani
of
these
plan
will
cost
monei
which
is
why
I
ve
laid
out
how
I
ll
pai
for
everi
dime
by
close
corpor
loophol
and
tax
haven
that
don
t
help
America
grow
But
I
will
also
go
through
the
feder
budget
line
by
line
elimin
program
that
no
longer
work
and
make
the
on
we
do
need
work
better
and
cost
less
becaus
we
cannot
meet
twenti
first
centuri
challeng
with
a
twentieth
centuri
bureaucraci
And
Democrat
we
must
also
admit
that
fulfil
America
s
promis
will
requir
more
than
just
monei
It
will
requir
a
renew
sens
of
respons
from
each
of
us
to
recov
what
John
F
Kennedi
call
our
intellectu
and
moral
strength
Ye
govern
must
lead
on
energi
independ
but
each
of
us
must
do
our
part
to
make
our
home
and
busi
more
effici
Ye
we
must
provid
more
ladder
to
success
for
young
men
who
fall
into
live
of
crime
and
despair
But
we
must
also
admit
that
program
alon
can
t
replac
parent
that
govern
can
t
turn
off
the
televis
and
make
a
child
do
her
homework
that
father
must
take
more
respons
for
provid
the
love
and
guidanc
their
children
need
Individu
respons
and
mutual
respons
that
s
the
essenc
of
America
s
promis
And
just
as
we
keep
our
keep
our
promis
to
the
next
gener
here
at
home
so
must
we
keep
America
s
promis
abroad
If
John
McCain
want
to
have
a
debat
about
who
ha
the
tempera
and
judgment
to
serv
as
the
next
Command
in
Chief
that
s
a
debat
I
m
readi
to
have
For
while
Senat
McCain
wa
turn
hi
sight
to
Iraq
just
dai
after
9
11
I
stood
up
and
oppos
thi
war
know
that
it
would
distract
us
from
the
real
threat
we
face
When
John
McCain
said
we
could
just
muddl
through
in
Afghanistan
I
argu
for
more
resourc
and
more
troop
to
finish
the
fight
against
the
terrorist
who
actual
attack
us
on
9
11
and
made
clear
that
we
must
take
out
Osama
bin
Laden
and
hi
lieuten
if
we
have
them
in
our
sight
John
McCain
like
to
sai
that
he
ll
follow
bin
Laden
to
the
Gate
of
Hell
but
he
won
t
even
go
to
the
cave
where
he
live
And
todai
as
my
call
for
a
time
frame
to
remov
our
troop
from
Iraq
ha
been
echo
by
the
Iraqi
govern
and
even
the
Bush
Administr
even
after
we
learn
that
Iraq
ha
a
79
billion
surplu
while
we
re
wallow
in
deficit
John
McCain
stand
alon
in
hi
stubborn
refus
to
end
a
misguid
war
That
s
not
the
judgment
we
need
That
won
t
keep
America
safe
We
need
a
Presid
who
can
face
the
threat
of
the
futur
not
keep
grasp
at
the
idea
of
the
past
You
don
t
defeat
a
terrorist
network
that
oper
in
eighti
countri
by
occupi
Iraq
You
don
t
protect
Israel
and
deter
Iran
just
by
talk
tough
in
Washington
You
can
t
truli
stand
up
for
Georgia
when
you
ve
strain
our
oldest
allianc
If
John
McCain
want
to
follow
Georg
Bush
with
more
tough
talk
and
bad
strategi
that
is
hi
choic
but
it
is
not
the
chang
we
need
We
ar
the
parti
of
Roosevelt
We
ar
the
parti
of
Kennedi
So
don
t
tell
me
that
Democrat
won
t
defend
thi
countri
Don
t
tell
me
that
Democrat
won
t
keep
us
safe
The
Bush
McCain
foreign
polici
ha
squander
the
legaci
that
gener
of
American
Democrat
and
Republican
have
built
and
we
ar
here
to
restor
that
legaci
As
Command
in
Chief
I
will
never
hesit
to
defend
thi
nation
but
I
will
onli
send
our
troop
into
harm
s
wai
with
a
clear
mission
and
a
sacr
commit
to
give
them
the
equip
thei
need
in
battl
and
the
care
and
benefit
thei
deserv
when
thei
come
home
I
will
end
thi
war
in
Iraq
respons
and
finish
the
fight
against
al
Qaeda
and
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
I
will
rebuild
our
militari
to
meet
futur
conflict
But
I
will
also
renew
the
tough
direct
diplomaci
that
can
prevent
Iran
from
obtain
nuclear
weapon
and
curb
Russian
aggress
I
will
build
new
partnership
to
defeat
the
threat
of
the
21st
centuri
terror
and
nuclear
prolifer
poverti
and
genocid
climat
chang
and
diseas
And
I
will
restor
our
moral
stand
so
that
America
is
onc
again
that
last
best
hope
for
all
who
ar
call
to
the
caus
of
freedom
who
long
for
live
of
peac
and
who
yearn
for
a
better
futur
These
ar
the
polici
I
will
pursu
And
in
the
week
ahead
I
look
forward
to
debat
them
with
John
McCain
But
what
I
will
not
do
is
suggest
that
the
Senat
take
hi
posit
for
polit
purpos
Becaus
on
of
the
thing
that
we
have
to
chang
in
our
polit
is
the
idea
that
peopl
cannot
disagre
without
challeng
each
other
s
charact
and
patriot
The
time
ar
too
seriou
the
stake
ar
too
high
for
thi
same
partisan
playbook
So
let
us
agre
that
patriot
ha
no
parti
I
love
thi
countri
and
so
do
you
and
so
doe
John
McCain
The
men
and
women
who
serv
in
our
battlefield
mai
be
Democrat
and
Republican
and
Independ
but
thei
have
fought
togeth
and
bled
togeth
and
some
di
togeth
under
the
same
proud
flag
Thei
have
not
serv
a
Red
America
or
a
Blue
America
thei
have
serv
the
Unite
State
of
America
So
I
ve
got
new
for
you
John
McCain
We
all
put
our
countri
first
America
our
work
will
not
be
easi
The
challeng
we
face
requir
tough
choic
and
Democrat
as
well
as
Republican
will
need
to
cast
off
the
worn
out
idea
and
polit
of
the
past
For
part
of
what
ha
been
lost
these
past
eight
year
can
t
just
be
measur
by
lost
wage
or
bigger
trade
deficit
What
ha
also
been
lost
is
our
sens
of
common
purpos
our
sens
of
higher
purpos
And
that
s
what
we
have
to
restor
We
mai
not
agre
on
abort
but
sure
we
can
agre
on
reduc
the
number
of
unwant
pregnanc
in
thi
countri
The
realiti
of
gun
ownership
mai
be
differ
for
hunter
in
rural
Ohio
than
for
those
plagu
by
gang
violenc
in
Cleveland
but
don
t
tell
me
we
can
t
uphold
the
Second
Amendment
while
keep
AK

out
of
the
hand
of
crimin
I
know
there
ar
differ
on
same
sex
marriag
but
sure
we
can
agre
that
our
gai
and
lesbian
brother
and

deserv
to
visit
the
person
thei
love
in
the
hospit
and
to

Passion
fly
on

but
I
don
t
know
anyon
who
benefit
when
a
mother
is
separ
from
her
infant
child
or
an
employ
undercut
American
wage
by
hire
illeg
worker
Thi
too
is
part
of
America
s
promis
the
promis
of
a
democraci
where
we
can
find
the
strength
and
grace
to
bridg
divid
and
unit
in
common
effort
I
know
there
ar
those
who
dismiss
such
belief
as
happi
talk
Thei
claim
that
our
insist
on
someth
larger
someth
firmer
and
more
honest
in
our
public
life
is
just
a
Trojan
Hors
for
higher
tax
and
the
abandon
of
tradit
valu
And
that
s
to
be
expect
Becaus
if
you
don
t
have
ani
fresh
idea
then
you
us
stale
tactic
to
scare
the
voter
If
you
don
t
have
a
record
to
run
on
then
you
paint
your
oppon
as
someon
peopl
should
run
from
You
make
a
big
elect
about
small
thing
And
you
know
what
it
s
work
befor
Becaus
it
feed
into
the
cynic
we
all
have
about
govern
When
Washington
doesn
t
work
all
it
promis
seem
empti
If
your
hope
have
been
dash
again
and
again
then
it
s
best
to
stop
hope
and
settl
for
what
you
alreadi
know
I
get
it
I
realiz
that
I
am
not
the
likeliest
candid
for
thi
offic
I
don
t
fit
the
typic
pedigre
and
I
haven
t
spent
my
career
in
the
hall
of
Washington
But
I
stand
befor
you
tonight
becaus
all
across
America
someth
is
stir
What
the
nai
sayer
don
t
understand
is
that
thi
elect
ha
never
been
about
me
It
s
been
about
you
For
eighteen
long
month
you
have
stood
up
on
by
on
and
said
enough
to
the
polit
of
the
past
You
understand
that
in
thi
elect
the
greatest
risk
we
can
take
is
to
try
the
same
old
polit
with
the
same
old
player
and
expect
a
differ
result
You
have
shown
what
histori
teach
us
that
at
defin
moment
like
thi
on
the
chang
we
need
doesn
t
come
from
Washington
Chang
come
to
Washington
Chang
happen
becaus
the
American
peopl
demand
it
becaus
thei
rise
up
and
insist
on
new
idea
and
new
leadership
a
new
polit
for
a
new
time
America
thi
is
on
of
those
moment
I
believ
that
as
hard
as
it
will
be
the
chang
we
need
is
come
Becaus
I
ve
seen
it
Becaus
I
ve
live
it
I
ve
seen
it
in
Illinoi
when
we
provid
health
care
to
more
children
and
move
more
famili
from
welfar
to
work
I
ve
seen
it
in
Washington
when
we
work
across
parti
line
to
open
up
govern
and
hold
lobbyist
more
account
to
give
better
care
for
our
veteran
and
keep
nuclear
weapon
out
of
terrorist
hand
And
I
ve
seen
it
in
thi
campaign
In
the
young
peopl
who
vote
for
the
first
time
and
in
those
who
got
involv
again
after
a
veri
long
time
In
the
Republican
who
never
thought
thei
d
pick
up
a
Democrat
ballot
but
did
I
ve
seen
it
in
the
worker
who
would
rather
cut
their
hour
back
a
dai
than
see
their
friend
lose
their
job
in
the
soldier
who
re
enlist
after
lose
a
limb
in
the
good
neighbor
who
take
a
stranger
in
when
a
hurrican
strike
and
the
floodwat
rise
Thi
countri
of
our
ha
more
wealth
than
ani
nation
but
that
s
not
what
make
us
rich
We
have
the
most
power
militari
on
Earth
but
that
s
not
what
make
us
strong
Our
univers
and
our
cultur
ar
the
envi
of
the
world
but
that
s
not
what
keep
the
world
come
to
our
shore
Instead
it
is
that
American
spirit
that
American
promis
that
push
us
forward
even
when
the
path
is
uncertain
that
bind
us
togeth
in
spite
of
our
differ
that
make
us
fix
our
ey
not
on
what
is
seen
but
what
is
unseen
that
better
place
around
the
bend
That
promis
is
our
greatest
inherit
It
s
a
promis
I
make
to
my
daughter
when
I
tuck
them
in
at
night
and
a
promis
that
you
make
to
your
a
promis
that
ha
led
immigr
to
cross
ocean
and
pioneer
to
travel
west
a
promis
that
led
worker
to
picket
line
and
women
to
reach
for
the
ballot
And
it
is
that
promis
that
forti
five
year
ago
todai
brought
American
from
everi
corner
of
thi
land
to
stand
togeth
on
a
Mall
in

befor
Lincoln
s
Memori
and
hear
a
young
preacher
from
Georgia
speak
of
hi
dream
The
men
and
women
who
gather
there
could
ve
heard
mani
thing
Thei
could
ve
heard
word
of
anger
and
discord
Thei
could
ve
been
told
to
succumb
to
the
fear
and
frustrat
of
so
mani
dream
defer
But
what
the
peopl
heard
instead
peopl
of
everi
creed
and
color
from
everi
walk
of
life
is
that
in
America
our
destini
is
inextric
link
That
togeth
our
dream
can
be

We
cannot

And
as
we

we

make
the
pledg
that
we

We

America
we
cannot

Not
with
so
much
work
to
be

Not

so
mani

so
mani

Not

We

At
thi

in
thi

we

Let
us
