If
there
is
anyon
out
there
who
still
doubt
that
America
is
a
place
where
all
thing
ar
possibl
who
still
wonder
if
the
dream
of
our
founder
is
aliv
in
our
time
who
still
question
the
power
of
our
democraci
tonight
is
your
answer
It
s
the
answer
told
by
line
that
stretch
around
school
and
church
in
number
thi
nation
ha
never
seen
by
peopl
who
wait
three
hour
and
four
hour
mani
for
the
veri
first
time
in
their
live
becaus
thei
believ
that
thi
time
must
be
differ
that
their
voic
could
be
that
differ
It

spoken

Latino
Asian
Nativ
American
gai
straight
disabl

never
been

collect
of
Red
State
and
Blue
State
we
ar
and
alwai
will
be
the
Unite
State
of
America
It
s
the
answer
that
led
those
who
have
been
told
for
so
long
by
so
mani
to
be
cynic
and
fear
and
doubt
of
what
we
can
achiev
to
put
their
hand
on
the
arc
of
histori
and
bend
it
onc
more
toward
the
hope
of
a
better
dai
It

I

I

To

truli
belong
to

to
you
I
wa
never
the
likeliest
candid
for
thi
offic
We
didn
t
start
with
much
monei
or
mani
endors
Our
campaign
wa
not
hatch
in
the
hall
of
Washington
it
began
in
the
backyard
of
De
Moin
and
the
live
room
of
Concord
and
the
front
porch
of
Charleston
It
wa
built
by
work
men
and
women
who
dug
into
what
littl
save
thei
had
to
give
five
dollar
and
ten
dollar
and
twenti
dollar
to
thi
caus
It
grew
strength
from
the
young
peopl
who
reject
the
myth
of
their
gener
s
apathi
who
left
their
home
and
their
famili
for
job
that
offer
littl
pai
and
less
sleep
from
the
not
so
young
peopl
who
brave
the
bitter
cold
and
scorch
heat
to
knock
on
the
door
of
perfect
stranger
from
the
million
of
American
who
volunt
and
organ
and
prove
that
more
than
two

later
a

Thi

I
know
you
didn
t
do
thi
just
to
win
an

and
I
know
you
didn
t
do
it
for
me
You
did
it
becaus
you
understand
the
enorm
of
the
task
that

ahead
For
even
as
we

tonight
we
know
the
challeng
that
tomorrow
will
bring

the
greatest
of
our
lifetim
two

a

the

Even
as
we
stand
here
tonight
we
know
there
ar
brave
American
wake
up
in
the
desert
of
Iraq
and
the
mountain
of
Afghanistan
to
risk
their
live
for
us
There
ar
mother
and

who
will
lie
awak
after
their

fall
asleep
and
wonder
how

There

new

to

and
threat

and
allianc

The
road
ahead
will
be

Our
climb
will
be
steep
We
mai
not

there
in
on

or
even
on

but
America
I
have
never

more
hope
than
I

tonight
that
we

I

There

There

I

But
I
will
alwai
be
honest
with

about

I
will
listen

And
abov
all
I
will
ask
you
join
in
the
work
of

What
began

on

in
the
depth
of

must
not
end
on
thi
autumn
night
Thi
victori
alon
is
not
the
chang
we
seek
it
is
onli
the
chanc
for
us
to
make
that
chang
And
that
cannot
happen
if
we
go
back
to
the
wai
thing
were
It
cannot
happen
without
you
So
let
us
summon
a
new
spirit
of
patriot
of
servic
and
respons
where
each
of
us
resolv
to
pitch
in
and
work
harder
and
look
after
not
onli
ourselv
but
each

Let
us
rememb
that
if

Wall

while
Main

suffer
in
thi

we
rise
or
fall
as
on

as
on

Let
us
resist
the
temptat
to
fall
back
on
the
same
partisanship
and
petti
and
immatur
that
ha
poison
our
polit
for
so
long
Let
us
rememb
that
it
wa
a
man
from
thi
state
who
first
carri
the
banner
of
the
Republican
Parti
to
the
White
Hous
a
parti
found
on
the
valu
of
self
relianc
individu
liberti
and
nation
uniti
Those
ar
valu
we
all
share
and
while
the
Democrat
Parti
ha
won
a
great
victori
tonight
we
do
so
with
a
measur
of
humil
and
determin
to
heal
the
divid
that
have
held
back
our
progress
As
Lincoln
said
to
a
nation
far
more
divid
than
our
We
ar
not
enemi
but
friend
though
passion
mai
have
strain
it
must
not
break
our
bond
of
affect
And
to
those
American
whose
support
I
have
yet
to
earn
I
mai
not
have
won
your
vote
but
I
hear
your
voic
I
need
your
help
and
I
will
be
your
Presid
too
And
to
all
those
watch
tonight
from
beyond
our
shore
from
parliament
and
palac
to
those
who
ar
huddl
around
radio
in
the
forgotten
corner
of
our
world
our
stori
ar
singular
but
our
destini
is
share
and
a
new
dawn
of
American
leadership
is
at
hand
To
those
who
would
tear
thi
world
down
we
will
defeat
you
To
those
who
seek
peac
and
secur
we
support
you
And
to
all
those
who
have
wonder
if
America
s
beacon
still
burn
as
bright
tonight
we
prove
onc
more
that
the
true
strength
of
our
nation
come
not
from
our
the
might
of
our
arm
or
the
scale
of
our
wealth
but
from
the
endur
power
of
our
ideal
democraci
liberti
opportun
and
unyield
hope
For
that
is
the
true
geniu
of
America
that
America
can
chang
Our
union
can
be
perfect
And
what
we
have
alreadi
achiev
give
us
hope
for
what
we
can
and
must
achiev
tomorrow
Thi
elect
had
mani
first
and
mani
stori
that
will
be
told
for
gener
But
on
that
s
on
my
mind
tonight
is
about
a
woman
who
cast
her
ballot
in
Atlanta
She
s
a
lot
like
the
million
of
other
who
stood
in
line
to
make
their
voic
heard
in
thi
elect
except
for
on
thing
Ann
Nixon
Cooper
is
106
year
old
She
wa
born
just
a
gener
past
slaveri
a
time
when
there
were
no
car
on
the
road
or
plane
in
the
sky
when
someon
like
her
couldn
t
vote
for
two
reason
becaus
she
wa
a
woman
and
becaus
of
the
color
of
her
skin
And
tonight
I
think
about
all
that
she
s
seen
throughout
her
centuri
in
America
the
heartach
and
the
hope
the
struggl
and
the
progress
the
time
we
were
told
that
we
can
t
and
the
peopl
who
press
on
with
that
American
creed
Ye
we
can
At
a
time
when
women
s
voic
were
silenc
and
their
hope
dismiss
she
live
to
see
them
stand
up
and
speak
out
and
reach
for
the
ballot
Ye
we
can
When
there
wa
despair
in
the
dust
bowl
and
depress
across
the
land
she
saw
a
nation
conquer
fear
itself
with
a
New
Deal
new
job
and
a
new
sens
of
common
purpos
Ye
we
can
When
the
bomb
fell
on
our
harbor
and
tyranni
threaten
the
world
she
wa
there
to
wit
a
gener
rise
to
great
and
a
democraci
wa
save
Ye
we
can
She
wa
there
for
the
buse
in
Montgomeri
the
hose
in
Birmingham
a
bridg
in
Selma
and
a
preacher
from
Atlanta
who
told
a
peopl
that
We
Shall
Overcom
Ye
we
can
A
man
touch
down
on
the
moon
a
wall
came
down
in
Berlin
a
world
wa
connect
by
our
own
scienc
and
imagin
And
thi
year
in
thi
elect
she
touch
her
finger
to
a
screen
and
cast
her
vote
becaus
after
106
year
in
America
through
the
best
of
time
and
the
darkest
of
hour
she
know
how
America
can
chang
Ye
we
can
America
we
have
come
so
far
We
have
seen
so
much
But
there
is
so
much
more
to
do
So
tonight
let
us
ask
ourselv
if
our
children
should
live
to
see
the
next
centuri
if
my
daughter
should
be
so
lucki
to
live
as
long
as
Ann
Nixon
Cooper
what
chang
will
thei
see
What
progress
will
we
have
made
Thi
is
our
chanc
to
answer
that
call
Thi
is
our
moment
Thi
is
our
time
to
put
our
peopl
back
to
work
and
open
door
of
opportun
for
our
kid
to
restor
prosper
and
promot
the
caus
of
peac
to
reclaim
the
American
Dream
and
reaffirm
that
fundament
truth
that
out
of
mani
we
ar
on
that
while
we
breath
we
hope
and
where
we
ar
met
with
cynic
and
doubt
and
those
who
tell
us
that
we
can
t
we
will
respond
with
that
timeless
creed
that
sum
up
the
spirit
of
a
peopl
Ye
We
Can
Thank
you
God
bless
you
and
mai
God
Bless
the
Unite
