He

You

Just

So

Our

We

But
thei

And

Right
now
think
of
thi
We

So
thei
come

thei
take
our
job
thei
take
our
monei
and
then
thei
loan
us
back
the
monei
and
we
pai
them
in
interest
and
then
the
dollar
goe
up
so
their
deal
s
even
better
How
stupid
ar
our
leader
How
stupid
ar
these
politician
to
allow
thi
to
happen
How
stupid
ar
thei
I
m
go
to
tell
you
thank
you
I
m
go
to
tell
you
a
coupl
of
stori
about
trade
becaus
I
m
total
against
the
trade
bill
for
a
number
of
reason
Number
on
the
peopl
negoti
don
t
have
a
clue
Our
presid
doesn
t
have
a
clue
He
s
a
bad
negoti
He
s
the
on
that
did
Bergdahl
We
get
Bergdahl
thei
get
five
killer
terrorist
that
everybodi
want
over
there
We
get
Bergdahl
We
get
a
traitor
We
get
a
no
good
traitor
and
thei
get
the
five
peopl
that
thei
want
for
year
and
those
peopl
ar
now
back
on
the
battlefield
try
to
kill
us
That
s
the
negoti
we
have
Take
a
look
at
the
deal
he
s
make
with
Iran
He
make
that
deal
Israel
mayb
won
t
exist
veri
long
It
s
a
disast
and
we
have
to
protect
Israel
But
So
we
need
peopl
I
m
a
free
trader
But
the
problem
with
free
trade
is
you
need
realli
talent
peopl
to
negoti
for
you
If
you
don
t
have
talent
peopl
if
you
don
t
have
great
leadership
if
you
don
t
have
peopl
that
know
busi
not
just
a
polit
hack
that
got
the
job
becaus
he
made
a
contribut
to
a
campaign
which
is
the
wai
all
job
just
about
ar
gotten
free
trade
terribl
Free
trade
can
be
wonder
if
you
have
smart
peopl
but
we
have
peopl
that
ar
stupid
We
have
peopl
that
aren
t
smart
And
we
have
peopl
that
ar
control
by
special
interest
And
it
s
just
not
go
to
work
So
here
s
a
coupl
of
stori
happen
recent
A
friend
of
mine
is
a
great
manufactur
And
you
know
China
come
over
and
thei
dump
all
their
stuff
and
I
bui
it
I
bui
it
becaus
frankli
I
have
an
oblig
to
bui
it
becaus
thei
devalu
their
currenc
so
brilliantli
thei
just
did
it
recent
and
nobodi
thought
thei
could
do
it
again
But
with
all
our
problem
with
Russia
with
all
our
problem
with
everyth
everyth
thei
got
awai
with
it
again
And
it
s
imposs
for
our
peopl
here
to
compet
So
I
want
to

You

Everi

it
Now
here

what
is
go

And
guess

No

So

other
dai
But
Mr

you
re
not
a
nice
person
How
can
you
get
peopl
to
vote
for

I
said
I
don

I
said
I

number
on
I
am
a
nice
person
I
give
a
lot
of
monei
awai
to
chariti
and
other
thing
I
think
I
m
actual

veri
nice
person
But
I
said
Thi
is
go
to
be
an
elect
that
s
base
on
compet
becaus
peopl
ar
tire
of
these
nice
peopl
And
thei
re
tire
of
be
rip
off
by
everybodi
in

world
And
thei
re
tire
of
spend
more
monei
on
educ
than
ani
nation
in
the
world
per

countri
But
we

becom
a
third
word
countri
becaus
of
our
infrastructur

everyth
So
on
of
the
thing
I
did
and
I
said
you
know
what
I
ll
do
I
ll
do
it
Becaus
a
lot
of
peopl
said
He
ll
never
run
Number
on
he
won
t
want
to
give

hi
lifestyl
Thei

that
but
I
m
do
it
Number
two
I
m
a
privat
compani
so
nobodi
know
what
I

And
the
on
thing
is
that
when
you
run
you
have
to
announc
and
certifi
to
all
sort
of
government
author
your
net
worth
So
I
said
That
s
OK
I
m
proud
of
my
net
worth
I
ve
done
an
amaz
job
I

He

But
I

a
lot
But
he
us
to
sai
Donald

That
s
the
big
leagu
We

all

of
the
pundit
on

Well
Donald

So
a
larg
account
firm
and
my
account
have
been
work
for
month
becaus
it
s
big
and
complex
and
thei
ve
put
togeth
a
statement
a
financi
statement
just
a
summari
But
everyth
will
be

eventu
with
the

and
we
don

or

We
ll
be
file
it
right
on
time
We
don
t
need
anyth
And
it
wa
even
report
incorrectli
yesterdai
becaus
thei
said
He
had
asset
of
9
billion
So
I
said
ph
No
that
s
the
wrong
number
That
s
the
wrong
number
Not
asset
So
thei
put
togeth
thi
And
befor
I
sai
it
I
have
to
sai
thi
I
made
it
the
old
fashion
wai
It
s
real
estat
You
know
it
s
real
estat
It
s
labor
and
it
s
union
good
and
some
bad
and
lot
of
peopl
that
aren
t
in
union
and
it
s
all
over
the
place
and
build
all
over
the
world
And
I
have
asset
big
account
firm
on
of
the
most
highli
respect
9
billion
240
million
dollar
And
I
have
liabil
of
about
500
million
ph
That
s
long
term
debt
veri
low
interest
rate
In
fact
on
of
the
big
bank
came
to
me
and
said
Donald
you
don
t
have
enough
borrow
Could
we
loan
you
4
billion
I
said
I
don
t
need
it
I
don
t
want
it
And
I
ve
been
there
I
don
t
want
it
But
in
two
second
thei
give
me
whatev
I
want
So
I
have
a
total
net
worth
and
now
with
the
increas
it
ll
be
well
over
10
billion
But
here
a
total
net
worth
of
net
worth
not
asset
not
a
net
worth
after
all
debt
after
all
expens
the
greatest
asset
Trump
Tower
1290
Avenu
of
the
America
Bank
of
America
build
in
San
Francisco
40
Wall
Street
sometim
refer
to
as
the
Trump
build
right
opposit
the
New
York
mani
other
place
all
over
the
world
So
the
total
is
8
737
540
00
Now
I
m
not
do
that
I
m
not
do
that
to
brag
becaus
you
know
what
I
don
t
have
to
brag
I
don
t
have
to
believ
it
or
not
I
m
do
that
to
sai
that
that
s
the
kind
of
think
our
countri
need
We
need
that
think
We
have
the
opposit
think
We
have
loser
We
have
loser
We
have
peopl
that
don
t
have
it
We
have
peopl
that
ar
moral
corrupt
We
have
peopl
that
ar
sell
thi
countri
down
the
drain
So
I
put
togeth
thi
statement
and
the
onli
reason
I
m
tell
you
about
it
todai
is
becaus
we
realli
do
have
to
get
go
becaus
if
we
have
anoth
three
or
four
year
you
know
we
re
at
8
trillion
now
We
re
soon
go
to
be
at
20
trillion
Accord
to
the
economist
who
I
m
not
big
believ
in
but
nevertheless
thi
is
what
thei
re
sai
that
24
trillion
we
re
veri
close
that
s
the
point
of
no
return
24
trillion
We
will
be
there
soon
That
s
when
we
becom
Greec
That
s
when
we
becom
a
countri
that
s
unsalvag
And
we
re
gonna
be
there
veri
soon
We
re
gonna
be
there
veri
soon
So
just
to
sum
up
I
would
do
variou
thing
veri
quickli
I
would
repeal
and
replac
the
big
lie
Obamacar
I
would
build

veri
inexpens
I

great
wall
on

southern
border
And
I
will
have
Mexico
pai
for
that
wall
Mark
my
word
Nobodi
would
be
tougher
on
ISIS
than
Donald
Trump
Nobodi
I
will
find
within
our
militari
I
will
find
the
Gener

or
I
will
find
Gener

I
will
find
the
right
