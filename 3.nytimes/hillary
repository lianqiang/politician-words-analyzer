Because
when
you’re
running
for
president
and
you
become
the
nominee,
that’s
kind
of
expected,

So
you’ve
got
to
ask
yourself,
why
doesn’t
he
want
to
release
them?

Donald
Trump’s
tax
plan
was
written
by
a
billionaire
for
billionaires,

I’m
also
in
favor
of
what’s
called
the
public
option,
so
that
people
can
buy
into
Medicare
at
a
certain
age,

It
has
gotten
to
the
point
where
people
are
being
asked
to
pay
not
just
hundreds
but
thousands
of
dollars
for
a
single
pill,

Israel
has
every
reason
to
be
alarmed
by
a
regime
that
both
denies
its
existence
and
seeks
its
destruction,

Despite
what
other
candidates
say,
we
believe
in
the
goodness
of
our
people
and
the
greatness
of
our
nation,

Imagine
a
tomorrow
where
hard
work
is
honored,
families
are
supported,
streets
are
safe
and
communities
are
strong,
and
where
love
trumps
hate,

I’m
really
focused
on
moving
into
the
general
election,

When
someone
shows
you
who
they
are,
believe
them,

We
have
to
destroy
her
story,

is
a
mover,

When
it
was
happening
in
real
time,
there
was
no
classification
and
that’s
what
you
have
to
be
guided
by,

This
just
beggars
the
imagination,

I’m
well
aware
of
the
drip,
drip,
drip,

Don’t
let
anybody
tell
you
that,
you
know,
it’s
corporations
and
businesses
that
create
jobs,

Under
Stephanie’s
leadership,
Emily’s
List
is
bigger,
stronger,
younger
and
more
diverse
than
ever,

What’s
happening
on
that
front?

I’ve
lost
more
sleep
than
all
of
you
put
together.
I
have
been
racking
my
brain
about
what
more
could
have
been
done
or
should
have
been
done.

That’s
what
happened
during
the
Reagan
administration,
when
Hezbollah
attacked
our
embassy,

Stupid
question,

inaccurate
or
incomplete

I
have
no
idea.

I
think
the
rest
of
America
could
learn
from
New
Hampshire,

Oh,
come
on,
liberate
yourself
and
ask
the
question
you
want
to
ask,

Thank
you!

No.
Not
at
all,

We
have
to
stand
up
to
his
bullying,

We
should
get
this
around
asap

Trump
actually
says
he
would
do
a
much
better
job
for
women
than
I
would,

How
much
longer
will
we
just
shrug?

Well,
I
recall
very
well
being
on
a
debate
stage,
I
think,
about
25
times
with
then-Senator
Obama,
debating
this
very
issue,

Iranians,
probably
the
Republicans.

We
are
not
Denmark,

We’ve
got
a
pretty
dysfunctional
mess
in
Washington,

Abu
Mazen
wants
to
see
it,

I
know
Bernie,

We
are
all
accountable
to
the
American
people
to
get
the
facts
right,
and
I
will
do
my
part,

People
can’t
rise
if
they
can’t
afford
health
care,

He’s
been
trafficking
in
prejudice
and
paranoia
through
this
campaign,

Looking
back,
it
would’ve
been
better
if
I’d
simply
used
a
second
email
account
and
carried
a
second
phone,
but
at
the
time,
this
didn’t
seem
like
an
issue,

It
was
my
practice
to
communicate
with
State
Department
and
other
government
officials
on
their
dot-gov
accounts
so
those
emails
would
be
automatically
saved
in
the
State
Department
system
to
meet
record-keeping
requirements,
and
that,
indeed,
is
what
happened,

I
did
not
email
any
classified
material
to
anyone
on
my
email,

the
top
1
percent
of
our
households

I
have
a
broader
view,

If
all
we
are
going
to
talk
about
is
one
part
of
our
economy,
and
indeed
one
street
in
our
economy,
we’re
missing
the
big
oil
companies,
we’re
missing
the
other
big
energy
companies,

Look
at
my
record,

Let’s
finally
do
something
about
the
growing
inequality
that
is
tearing
our
country
apart,

If
you’ve
got
something
to
say,
say
it
directly,
but
you
will
not
find
that
I
ever
changed
a
view
or
a
vote
because
of
any
donation
that
I
ever
received,

It
was
kind
of
a
low
blow,

I
fully
complied
with
every
rule
that
I
was
governed
by.

Here’s
what
the
other
side
counts
on,

She’s
ready
and
willing
to
come
and
appear
herself
for
a
hearing
open
to
the
American
public.

additional
steps
will
be
required
to
safeguard
and
protect
the
information.

We
have
always
had
an
open
line
of
communication
with
the
White
House,
from
our
time
at
the
State
Department
and
beyond,

Everyday
Americans
need
a
champion.
And
I
want
to
be
that
champion,

We
have
to
restore
economic
growth
with
rising
wages
for
the
vast
majority
of
Americans,
and
we
have
to
restore
trust
and
cooperation
within
our
political
system,

I
could
never
condone
what
he
did,

I
resist
saying
it
has
to
be
this
or
that.
I
think
there
has
to
be
a
balance,

It
requires
both
men
and
women
to
speak
up
about
this,

I’d
like
to
bring
people
from
right,
left,
red,
blue,
get
them
into
a
nice
warm
purple
space
where
everybody
is
talking
and
where
we’re
actually
trying
to
solve
problems,

There’s
a
lot
of
unfinished
business,

The
family
issue,
putting
family
first,
creating
more
supportive
work
environments,

There
may
be
some
new
voices
in
the
presidential
Republican
choir.
But
they’re
all
singing
the
same
old
song.

I’m
not
running
for
some
America,

Now
we
take
this
campaign
to
the
entire
country,

honest
and
trustworthy.

This
is
not
about
math.
This
is
about
people’s
lives,
and
we
should
level
with
the
American
people,

I
made
it
very
clear
that
those
children
needed
to
be
processed
appropriately,

I’m
not
asking
people
to
support
me
because
I’m
a
woman,

If
you’re
going
to
talk,
tell
the
whole
story.

Being
a
white
person
in
the
United
States
of
America,
I
know
that
I’ve
never
had
the
experience
that
so
many
of
the
people
in
this
audience
have
had.

I
know
the
state
of
Michigan
has
a
rainy-day
fund
for
emergencies,

super
predators.

I
will
stand
up
for
our
companies
in
Ohio
and
across
America,

Tomorrow,
this
campaign
goes
national!

Despite
what
you
hear,
we
don’t
need
to
make
America
great
again,

I
don’t
think
President
Obama
gets
the
credit
he
deserves
for
digging
us
out
of
the
ditch
Republicans
put
us
in,

We
look
at
our
country
and
see
so
much
that
isn’t
working
the
way
it
should,

I
can
pause
while
you’re
reading
your
notes
from
your
staff,

I
have
said
it
before,
and
I
will
repeat
it
again,

Well,
yes,
the
whole
night,

I’m
sorry,

Their
flamboyant
front-runner
has
grabbed
a
lot
of
attention
lately,
but
if
you
look
at
everyone
else’s
policies,
they’re
pretty
much
the
same,

an
idiot.

Late
Night
with
Seth
Meyers,

get
out
of
hand.

The
numbers
just
don’t
add
up
from
what
Senator
Sanders
is
proposing,

If
I’m
so
fortunate
as
to
be
the
nominee,
the
first
person
I
will
call
to
talk
to
about
where
we
go
and
how
we
get
it
done
will
be
Senator
Sanders,

I
know
I
am
in
a
contest
with
your
neighbor,

Well,
I
think
he
hadn’t
done
his
homework,

It
wasn’t
about
making
a
point,
it
was
about
making
a
difference,

you
may
just
end
up
with
a
candidate
who
says
the
president
never
legally
was
the
president
at
all.
Enough
is
enough.

If
you
want
to
know
where
that
kind
of
obstructionism
and
recklessness
leads,
just
look
at
the
Republican
race
for
the
presidency,

As
scary
as
it
might
be,
ask
yourselves,
what
kind
of
justice
will
a
President
Trump
appoint?

Whoever
America
elects
this
fall
will
help
determine
the
future
of
the
court
for
decades,

Slogans
aren’t
a
strategy.
Loose
cannons
tend
to
misfire,

We
chose
a
president.
We
chose
him
twice,

The
race
for
the
Democratic
nomination
is
in
the
home
stretch
and
victory
is
in
sight,

In
this
campaign,
we’ve
won
in
every
region
of
the
country,
from
the
North
to
the
South
to
the
East
to
the
West,

I’m
hoping
to
do
really
well,

I
love
New
York,

What’s
going
to
drive
her
through
the
South
are
African-American
women,

They
don’t
have
to
be
for
me,
I’m
going
to
be
for
them,

I
am
a
progressive
who
gets
things
done
for
people,

One
of
us
ran
against
Barack
Obama,

American
Muslims
are
on
the
front
line
of
our
defense,

I
am
not
a
single-issue
candidate,
and
I
do
not
believe
we
live
in
a
single-issue
country,

Creating
good
paying
jobs
and
raising
incomes
is
the
defining
economic
challenge
of
our
time,

We
must
raise
incomes
for
hard-working
Americans
so
they
can
afford
a
middle-class
life,

Too
many
of
our
major
financial
institutions
are
still
too
complex
and
too
risky,

The
current
definition
of
a
long-term
holding
period,
just
one
year,
is
woefully
inadequate,

A
survey
of
corporate
executives
found
that
more
than
half
would
hold
off
making
a
successful
long-term
investment
if
it
meant
missing
a
target
in
the
next
quarterly
earnings
report,

People
have
a
right
to
be
angry,

Who
is
the
best
change
maker?

It
isn’t
right
that
kids
I
met
in
Flint
on
Sunday
were
poisoned
because
their
governor
wanted
to
save
money,

I
am
here
because
for
nearly
two
years,
Flint’s
water
was
poisoned,

Congress
needs
to
pass
that
bill
immediately,

I’ll
tell
you
what,

I
literally
could
not
imagine
what
I
would
be
feeling
if
that
little
face
I
was
looking
at
was
one
of
the
faces
of
the
children
that
you
know
and
love
so
well,

I
very
much
appreciate
that
comment,
Bernie,

Joe
Biden
is
a
good
man
and
a
great
vice
president,

I
know,
standing
here
before
you,
that
one
of
my
principal
jobs
as
your
president
will
be
to
defend
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively
on
behalf
of
hard-working
Americans,

Maybe
when
I
finish
talking
to
the
people
here,

I
might,

Hey,
y’all
ready?

Any
trade
deal
I
would
support
must
increase
jobs,
must
increase
wages,
must
give
us
more
economic
competitive
power,

there
should
be
no
deal.

There
are
people
who
offer
themselves
to
be
leaders
whose
actions
have
undercut
this
fundamental
American
principle,

If
you
want
to
vote
in
this
state,
you
can
use
a
concealed
weapon
permit
as
a
valid
form
of
identification,
but
a
valid
student
ID
isn’t
good
enough,

Let’s
take
on
the
broader
inequities
in
our
society,
