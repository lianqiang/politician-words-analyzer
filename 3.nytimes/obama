and
our
answer
needs
to
be
more
than
tough
talk
or
calls
to
carpet
bomb
civilians.

We
may
be
able
to
save
a
whole
bunch
of
families
from
the
grief
that
some
of
the
people
in
this
audience
have
had
to
go
through.

we
are
fed
the
excuse
that
common-sense
reforms
like
background
checks
might
not
have
stopped
the
last
massacre,
or
the
one
before
that,
or
the
one
before
that,
so
why
bother
trying.
I
reject
that
thinking.
We
know
we
can’t
stop
every
act
of
violence,
every
act
of
evil
in
the
world.
But
maybe
we
could
try
to
stop
one
act
of
evil,
one
act
of
violence.

and
treat
it
like
the
national
economic
priority
that
it
is
for
all
of
us.

With
respect
to
climate
and
what’s
taking
place
here,
I
don’t
want
to
get
ahead
of
ourselves.
We
still
need
a
Paris
agreement.
So
my
main
focus
is
making
sure
that
the
United
States
is
a
leader
in
bringing
a
successful
agreement
home
here
in
Paris.

This
one
trend,
climate
change,
affects
all
trends,

to
say
that
the
United
States
of
America
not
only
recognizes
our
role
in
creating
this
problem,
we
embrace
our
responsibility
to
do
something
about
it.

The
United
States
of
America
not
only
recognizes
our
role
in
creating
this
problem,
we
embrace
our
responsibility
to
do
something
about
it,

We
will
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
support
our
friend
and
ally
Belgium
in
bringing
to
justice
those
who
are
responsible,

The
United
States
stands
ready
to
work
with
Argentina
through
this
historic
transition
in
any
way
that
we
can,

but
if
you
look
at
what
the
other
candidates
have
said,
that’s
pretty
troubling,
too.

Over
a
thousand
Americans
are
working
today
because
we
stopped
a
surge
in
Chinese
tires,

still
in
the
game,

is
that
it
gets
resolved
short
of
that.

Those
dangers
are
real.

The
Constitution
is
pretty
clear.

to
not
elevate
it,
to
not
somehow
buy
into
their
fantasy
that
they
are
doing
something
important.

is
here
to
stay,
