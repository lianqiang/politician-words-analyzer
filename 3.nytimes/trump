No,
no.

O.K.
I
want
all
the
girls
to
come
forward.

I
don’t
care
if
she’s
sweet,

I
am
not
necessarily
a
huge
fan
of
that,

We
are
all
that
man,

It
certainly
is
causing
people
to
look
at
the
broader
implications
of
trade
agreements,

I
don’t
mind
going
through
a
little
bit
of
a
slow
process,

but
if
I
held
back
payment,
it
was
probably
because
he
did
a
lousy
job.

They
don’t
look
like
Indians
to
me,

That
an
Indian
chief
is
going
to
tell
Joey
Killer
to
please
get
off
his
reservation
is
almost
unbelievable
to
me,

It
is
so
prestigious
down
in
Washington
to
represent
me
that
you
ought
to
be
willing
to
do
it
for
free,

Frankly,
if
Hillary
Clinton
were
a
man,
I
don’t
think
she
would
get
5
percent
of
the
vote,

but
what
is
this?

I’m
not
surprised
at
the
Bush
family,
in
all
fairness,
because
I’ve
been
very
critical
of
what
happened,

While
I
will
unify
the
party,
Lindsey
Graham
has
shown
himself
to
be
beyond
rehabilitation,

We
have
to
get
a
hand
around
a
very
serious
problem,

He’s
keeping
Cruz
where
he
is,

As
president,
I’ll
be
working
from
the
first
day
with
my
vice
president
and
staff
to
make
clear
that
America
will
be
changing
in
major
ways
for
the
better,

I
know
everyone
won’t
like
everything
I
do,
but
I’m
not
running
to
be
everyone’s
favorite
president,

We
have
to
take
a
tougher
stand
with
foreign
countries,

I
think
about
a
U.N.
ambassador,
about
a
secretary
of
defense
and
secretary
of
treasury,
but
I
think
more
about
winning
first,

Little
Marco,

As
soon
as
there’s
unity,
it’s
going
to
be
very
easy
to
do,

I
have
nothing
to
do
with
that,

I
hope
not.
I
hope
not.

I
watched
him.
And
I
learned
from
him.

was
caught
sort
of
in
the
middle
as
somebody
who
didn’t
really
love
it,
and
only
because
he
didn’t
really
love
it,
he
wasn’t
particularly
good
at
it,

For
me,
it
worked
very
well,

A
third
party
means
that
the
Democrats
are
going
to
win,
almost
certainly,

I
would
have
preferred
I
didn’t
send
it,

We’re
getting
out
of
the
nation-building
business
and
instead
focusing
on
creating
stability
on
the
world,

I
see
improved
relations
with
Russia,
from
a
position
of
strength,
as
possible,

I
have
to
respect
the
person
that,
if
it’s
not
me,
the
person
that
wins,

When
you
have
people
that
are
cutting
Christians’
heads
off,
when
you
have
a
world
at
the
border
and
at
so
many
places
that
it’s
medieval
times,

Somebody
said
he’s
not,
and
I
retweeted
it,

Just
the
other
day,
2
years
old,
2-and-a-half-years
old,
a
child,
a
beautiful
child
went
to
have
the
vaccine,
and
came
back,
and
a
week
later
got
a
tremendous
fever,
got
very,
very
sick,
now
is
autistic,

I
don’t
know
if
it
will
influence
many
Republicans
who
like
the
pope
or
don’t
like
the
pope,
but
what
influences
them
is
that
they
want
a
sealed
border,

It
was
a
retweet,

I
don’t
care.
Whether
people
support
or
endorse
me
or
not,
it
makes
zero
influence
on
the
voters.
Historically,
people
don’t
vote
based
on
who
is
vice
president.
I
want
someone
who
can
help
me
govern.

Everything
is
subject
to
negotiation,
but
I
can’t
and
won’t
be
changing
much,
because
the
voters
support
me
because
of
what
I’m
saying
and
how
I’m
saying
it,

How
many
times
do
I
have
to
continue
to
disavow
people?

Are
you
from
Mexico?

She
called
me
to
say
she’s
very
proud,

I
have
a
sister
who
just
doesn’t
want
to
talk
to
reporters.
Can
you
believe
it?

I’m
no
different
than
any
other
brother
that
loves
his
sister,

We
never
had
a
conflict,

I
always
loved
playing
with
blocks,
anything
having
to
do
with
blocks,

The
Macintoshes,
nice
people,

Peter
and
I
loved
sports,

I
wanted
them
to
move
into
Trump
Tower,
and
my
mother
loved
the
idea,

I
think
Israel
will
do
that
also,
yeah,

Israel
helps
us
in
the
Middle
East,

We
have
a
hospital
all
lined
up,
we’re
doing
great,

How
do
you
know
those
bruises
weren’t
there
before?

I
don’t
discard
people,

I
built
a
great,
great
company,

including
yours.

If
Saudi
Arabia
was
without
the
cloak
of
American
protection,

keeps
on
its
path,
its
current
path
of
weakness,
they’re
going
to
want
to
have
that
anyway,
with
or
without
me
discussing
it,

I’m
not
sure
that
I
would
want
to
be
talking
about
that,

You
could
see
there
was
blood
coming
out
of
her
eyes,
blood
coming
out
of
her
wherever.

Chris
can
tell
you,

I
have
to
respect
the
person,

I’m
a
guy
with
common
sense
that’s
going
to
make
us
a
fortune.

We
went
under
a
fence
and
through
a
fence,
and
oh,
boy,
it
felt
like
I
was
crossing
the
border,
actually,

Does
he
want
to
endorse
me?

and
I
don’t
know
how
it
got
there.

I
don’t
think
makes
any
difference
to
anybody
if
they
hear
the
story.

Yeah,
that
the
value
of
the
property
has
gone
up
substantially,

You
get
references
and
opinions
of
people,
and
you
go
on
that,

Meet
the
Press,

My
whole
life
has
been
leverage,
O.K.?

just
destroyed
his
relationship
with
women,

I
don’t
make
commitments
and
break
them,

So
you
have
a
silent
majority
in
this
country
that
feels
abused,
that
feels
forgotten,
that
feels
mistreated,
and
it’s
a
term
that
hasn’t
been
brought
up
in
years
as
you
know,

The
Travels
of
a
T-Shirt
in
the
Global
Economy,

I
am
all
for
free
trade,
but
it’s
got
to
be
fair,

He
leaves
me
alone,
but
he
knows
when
to
make
his
presence
felt,

I
was
told
to
be
nice
to
Paul
Ryan,

Frankly,
in
a
way
it’s
worse,
because
Cruz
is
establishment
and
yet
he’s
got
no
relationship
with
the
establishment,

and
has
set
us
back
so
far.

No
matter
who
you
are,
a
man
or
a
woman,
he
treats
everyone
equal,

all
the
best

Well,
I
was
turned
off
at
the
very
start
because
I
didn’t
like
his
language,

It
was
a
work
thing,
it
wasn’t
a
bad
thing,

I
was
actually
a
great
father,

They
should
be
so
lucky
to
be
as
unfit
as
him,

He
probably
didn’t
really
think
about
how
that
was
going
to
come
out,

Sit
down,

No,
you
don’t.
You
haven’t
been
called,

I
can’t
deal
with
this,

We
will,

He
died
praying
and
taking
care
of
people,

You
have
to
remember
I’m
leading.

The
one
problem
I
have
with
the
flat
tax
is
that
rich
people
are
paying
the
same
as
people
that
are
making
very
little
money,

Is
there
anybody
that
doesn’t
renegotiate
deals
in
this
room?

In
fact,
it’s
easier,

You
go
back
to
a
position
like
they
had
where
they
would
perhaps
go
to
illegal
places,

Maybe
he
should
have
been
roughed
up.

There
is
something
going
on
with
him
that
we
don’t
know
about,

You
know
what,
darling?
You’re
not
going
to
be
scared
anymore.
They’re
going
to
be
scared.
You’re
not
going
to
be
scared,

Can
anybody
be
that
dumb?

We
have
become
so
politically
correct
that
we
don’t
know
what
the
hell
we’re
doing,

All
of
’em
are
weak,
they’re
just
weak,

I
loved
that
dinner,

It
was
one
of
the
biggest
parades
in
the
history
of
New
York
City,
and
I
was
very
proud
to
have
made
it
possible.

To
anybody
who
suggests
that
John
and
his
fellow
P.O.W.s
are
somehow
lacking
in
the
title
of
being
called
American
hero,
you
shouldn’t
be
our
commander
in
chief
because
you
don’t
know
our
military,

All
excellent,

Only
a
lawyer
could
think
of
that,

I’d
like
to
punch
him
in
the
face.

He
puts
up
the
wrong
finger
and
we’re
supposed
to
take
it
nowadays,
folks,

We’ve
had
enough
debates,

You
have
to
let
people
do
their
job,
the
border
patrols,

We
just
landed,
and
there
were
a
lot
of
people
at
the
airport,
and
they
were
all
waving
American
flags
and
they
were
all
in
favor
of
Trump
and
what
I’m
doing,

Celebrity
Apprentice,

Do
you
think
there’s
tremendous
cost
for
the
illegals
that
are
in
here
right
now?

I
watch
the
shows,

He’s
made
so
many
flubs,
I
don’t
even
understand
it,

Deep
down
inside,
Al
likes
me
a
lot,

I
will
address
little
Rubio,

He’s
Hispanic,
which
is
fine,

The
Rubios
of
the
world
could
not
get
into
that
school,

I’ll
have
to
see
how
I’m
being
treated
by
the
Republicans,

He’s
just
fine,

For
him
to
get
things
done
is
very
hard.

Are
you
a
member
of
the
press?

When
it
comes
to
policy,
I’m
going
to
give
you
wonderful
policy
positions,

sick
and
tired
of
politicians,

Usually
when
people
do
the
small
diners
and
everything
is
because
they
can’t
get
anybody
to
show
up,
to
be
honest
with
you,

If
we
win
Iowa,
I
think
we
run
the
table,

He
will
fall
like
all
others,

Oil
gives
him
a
lot
of
money,

Isn’t
a
Trump
rally
much
more
exciting
than
these
other
ones?

You
should
have
gotten
here
earlier,

So
sad,

We’ve
had
it
before
and
we’ll
have
it
again,

We’re
going
to
start
winning
again
and
we’re
going
to
win
bigly,
believe
me,

I
think
that,
you
know,
a
lot
of
people
are
talking
about
certain
names,
and
certainly
those
are
the
names
that
we’re
thinking
of,

That
was
reported,
and
nobody
talks
about
it,

Frankly,
if
Hillary
Clinton
were
a
man,
I
don’t
think
she’d
get
5
percent
of
the
vote.
The
only
thing
she’s
got
going
is
the
women’s
card,

I
felt
it
was
just
safer.
I
don’t
want
to
see
anybody
get
hurt.

Honestly,
we
have
a
very
divided
country.

We
are
not
electing
an
entertainer
in
chief.
Showmanship
is
fun,
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
leadership
that
will
truly
change
America.

Seventy-six
percent
of
the
world’s
millionaires
made
their
fortunes
in
real
estate,

In
negotiation,
you
must
be
willing
to
walk,

I
am
malleable,

Newt
said
that?

I
don’t
use
Wall
Street
much
because
I
don’t
need
money,

I
was
the
king
of
approvals,

A
person
who
thinks
only
about
building
walls,
wherever
they
may
be,
and
not
building
bridges,
is
not
Christian,

some
form
of
punishment,

I
was
not
treated
well
by
Fox,

It’s
crunchtime,
folks,

The
truth
is,
I’d
like
to
do
well
here,
and
I
think
we’re
prepared
to
win
here,

You
never
really
know,
O.K.?
You
can
think
you’re
good
at
it,
you
can
think
you’re
going
to
do
well,

You’ve
called
women
you
don’t
like
fat,
pigs,
dogs,
slobs
and
disgusting
animals,

When
he
gets
in
there,
he’ll
figure
it
out,

Roger
Stone
is
a
nice
guy,
but
I
let
him
go
because
I
really
wasn’t
using
him
and
he
liked
to
get
a
lot
of
publicity
for
himself,
which
I
didn’t
want.

You’re
right,
but
from
what
I
understand
it
wouldn’t
have
mattered,

He
has
friends,
but
they’re
business-type
people,

devastating,
painful
and
hurtful.

no

He
may
have
this
crazy
public
persona,
but
around
the
building,
we
don’t
see
that,

loser

Our
jobs
are
being
sucked
out
of
our
states,

I
think
I’ll
get
there,

Are
you
a
Trump
supporter?

drunk,
standing
in
a
corner.

He’s
a
jealous
fool
and
not
a
bright
person,

I
don’t
think
so,

extremely
satisfied,

continues
to
waste
taxpayer
money
trying
to
smear
me,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
students
had
a
great
experience,

There’s
only
one
person
who
did
well
tonight,

They
are
bringing
drugs.
They
are
bringing
crime.
They’re
rapists,

So
far
I
cannot
believe
how
civil
it’s
been
up
here,

I
got
the
name.

They’re
also
really
nice
guys,

Bygones
are
bygones,

because
we
won.

panders
to
people’s
fears.

People
are
fed
up
of
being
told
what
they
can
or
can’t
think,

so-called
no-go
areas

Let’s
let
these
suckers
stand
up
there
for
another
hour
in
a
room
that
was
100
degrees,

I
would
talk
to
him,
I
would
get
along
with
him,

Your
brother
and
your
brother’s
administration
gave
us
Barack
Obama,
because
it
was
such
a
disaster
those
last
three
months
that
Abraham
Lincoln
couldn’t
have
been
elected,

One
of
the
greats
who
believed
in
broad
strokes
was
Ronald
Reagan,

they
finally
calmed
down.

fat
cats,

Totally
false,

I
think
she’s
got
a
beautiful
face,
and
she’s
a
beautiful
woman,

No,
because
I
said
nothing
wrong,

and
it’s
not
silent.

Well,
Jeb’s
more
popular
than
one
person,

Thank
you!

The
media
wants
to
make
this
issue
about
Obama,

I
don’t
like
to
second-guess
my
performances,

We’re
killing
everybody
in
the
polls,

I
don’t
think
Ben
has
the
energy,

I’m
not
going
to
call
her
honey,

I
want
to
talk
about
her
corporate
history,
her
failures
at
Hewlett-Packard,

I
think
this
is
a
temporary
loss
of
sanity,

I
have
great
respect
for
some
of
the
candidates,

I
don’t
think
they
like
me
very
much,

Going
back
to
George
Washington,
there
has
never
been
a
president
who
has
not
served
in
high
public
office,

They’re
killing
us,

I’m
surprised
nobody
picked
up
on
it
prior
to
him,

Nothing
that
I
stated
was
different
from
what
I
have
been
saying
for
many
years,

That
is
so
wrong,

First
of
all,
very
few
people
listen
to
your
radio
show,

I
was
certainly
surprised
to
the
extent
it
caught
on,

That
was
a
prime
site
for
river
crossings,

How
would
they
know
that?

Write
your
story
the
way
you
want
to
write
it,

that
were
frankly
unthinkable
a
year
ago,

unthinkable

I
don’t
want
to
be
afraid
to
vote
for
a
candidate,

Actually,
it
was
for
business,

He
was
a
failed
candidate,

The
people
in
Florida
wouldn’t
elect
him
dogcatcher,

I
have
a
very
strong
core,
but
I
have
never
seen
a
successful
person
who
wasn’t
flexible,

You
know,
I’m
not
a
big
sleeper,

I
don’t
repeat
myself,

We’re
going
to
win
a
lot,

After
all
the
noise
he’s
made,
he
has
to
be
here,

Instead
of
fighting
it,
get
used
to
it,

I
think
it’s
great,

I
saw
something
that
no
place
on
earth
could
have
handled
more
beautifully,
more
humanely
than
New
York,

I’m
just
referring
to
an
article
that
appeared,

He’s
a
major
loser,

absolutely
unbelievable,

I’ve
been
very
loyal
to
golf,

I
think
those
statements
are
unnecessary,

I
have
wonderful
alternatives,

I’d
rather
just
discuss
the
issues.

I
didn’t
know
what
the
hell
he
was
doing,
but
he
was
fighting,
and
I
like
a
fighter.
Does
that
make
sense?

I
tell
the
truth,
lobbyists,

They
lied.
They
said
there
were
weapons
of
mass
destruction,
and
there
were
none,

She
should
be
running,

The
World
Trade
Center
came
down
during
the
reign
of
George
Bush,

If
I
were
president
now,
I
would
certainly
want
to
try
to
nominate
a
justice,

You
are
the
single
biggest
liar,

I
just
quoted
his
book,

On
occasion,
in
order
to
sort
of
really
highlight
something,
I’ll
use
a
profanity,

It’s
going
to
be
an
amazing
two
months,

He
is
one
hell
of
a
competitor.

We’ll
see,

Women
are
looking
for
security
in
our
country,
and
they
know
I’m
going
to
do
the
best
job,

delusional

I
think
she
would
have
pressed
charges
anyway
because
I
think
she
likes
it,

When
did
you
actually
become
a
Republican?

He’s
an
embarrassment
to
his
family,

Why
is
he
here?

use
the
bathroom
they
feel
is
appropriate,

It
would
be
simple.
It
would
be
straightforward,

They’re
afraid
to
come
up
here
because
it
has
a
tendency
to
be
a
little
bit
liberal,
a
little
bit
rough,

Oh,
I
would
love
to
run
against
Bernie,

Don’t
give
him
his
coat,

We
have
to
keep
the
families
together,
but
they
have
to
go,

If
they
treat
me
properly,
I’m
going
to
treat
them
properly,

I
haven’t
flown
it,
but
I
can,

It’s
like
a
new
plane,

The
Art
of
the
Deal.

I
really
wouldn’t
know
what
he
looked
like.

Bayrock
knew
the
people,
knew
the
investors,
and
in
some
cases
I
believe
they
were
friends
of
Mr.
Arif,

He
hit
my
hands,

He
scammed
the
people
of
Florida,

I
want
Ted
one-on-one,
O.K.

He
doesn’t
look
like
a
motorcycle
guy
to
me,
I’m
sorry,

I
don’t
like
it,

I’m
a
businessman,
and
I
have
to
do
what
I
have
to
do,

I
won’t
get
my
information
from
the
shows,

I’m
Presbyterian,

Do
we
love
these
polls?

Believe
me,
I’m
not
dropping
out
of
anything,

I’m
not
going
to
take
legal
advice
from
Donald
Trump,

If
you
become
the
nominee,
who
the
hell
knows
if
you
can
even
serve
in
office?

Why
didn’t
they
call
the
police?

We
are
going
to
kick
your
rear
end
out
of
the
White
House
come
this
fall,

Believe
me,
I’m
a
unifier,

Call
it
what
you
want,
people
are
not
going
to
be
dying
on
the
street,

If
the
president
went
to
the
beach,
we
would
have
been
better
off,
believe
me.

I
was
standing
next
to
Rubio,
and
I
thought
he
just
got
out
of
a
swimming
pool,

We’ll
be
looking
at
that
and
a
lot
of
other
things,

We
need
give
and
take
in
government,

He
doesn’t
go
to
vote,

Look
at
those
hands.
Are
they
small
hands?

Look
at
that
face,

I
think
you
can
forget
about
him,

At
a
minimum,
how
can
someone
with
such
bad
judgment
be
our
next
president?

I
am
here
for
three
days,
then
coming
back
for
three
more,
